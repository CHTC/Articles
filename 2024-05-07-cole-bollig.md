[Cole Bollig](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/people)’s life after college began like most. As a twenty-something-year-old with a fresh degree, 
Bollig had a set plan for his future. He would program for a video game development studio, making perfect use of his newly received degree 
in Game Development with a technological emphasis from the University of Wisconsin–Whitewater.

Following the plan, though, was the problem. Applying to all the game studios in the Midwest, Bollig came up completely empty. 
The months passed by with no results and he knew something had to change. This led Bollig to widen his search to all kinds of computer 
science jobs in the area, and yet, he still struggled to find a job. “I just couldn’t find anything, and it was very draining,” Bollig explained. 
When the [Center for High Throughput Computing](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/) (CHTC) began looking for an [HTCondor](https://htcondor.org/) core developer, 
Bollig applied with little hope. He was overjoyed when he heard back from the organization. “I have a degree that doesn’t shout computer science,” 
he said, “so I was ecstatic when I got an interview.”

Bollig made it through the interview gauntlet and was offered the position. Finally out of the job market, Bollig had to get to work becoming 
a [DAGMan](https://htcondor.org/dagman/dagman.html) expert. DAGMan is an [HTCondor Software Suite](https://htcondor.org/) (HTCSS) tool which assists 
users in automatically managing workflows of HTCondor jobs, and it was Bollig’s job to take over all there is to know about the tool. This was no easy 
task, but the CHTC team was there to help. “It’s a very nurturing environment,” Bollig explained. “It’s a great place to grow and gain experience.” 
That’s why Bollig quickly became known as “Dag Boy” — a title bestowed upon Bollig by senior core developer Greg Thain — because he still had to 
grow up and master the DAGMan tool.

Aside from mastering DAGMan, Bollig had a lot to learn about high throughput computing (HTC). It wasn’t a perfect learning curve, either. “There was one
circumstance where I programmed something to work, but I didn’t do it the proper way.” Bollig said, “We had to scrap the whole thing and start over. 
Mistakes are allowed here, especially when you’re still learning. ”

Working at CHTC also meant becoming a part of the community. He plays sheepshead with the other core developers at lunch on Fridays and sometimes joins
in lengthy conversations about minecraft. CHTC also has annual events like the OSG School and high throughput computing week where Bollig has the opportunity 
to meet people from around the world who are interested in HTC.

Bollig has worked at CHTC for a little over two years now, and he remains grateful that someone was willing to give him a chance fresh out of college. 
“I emphasized I’d do my best to learn, but every place seemed to be searching for experienced candidates,” Bollig explained. “I just needed someone to give me a chance.”

Even after gaining a good amount of experience, Bollig plans to stay with CHTC for many years to come. He finds the job to be incredibly rewarding. 
“As a software engineer, I could be working at Facebook or Google to create a new obscure feature that a few people interact with and feed the 
pockets of Mark Zuckerberg. Instead, I’m helping the scientific community.”

Bollig believes CHTC could be a valuable option for other young job-seekers as well. He thinks CHTC supplies a great deal of patience for all employees, 
especially the ones new to the industry. Bollig also emphasizes the importance of being open to all kinds of job opportunities.
“Here I am doing high throughput computing software, but I went to school for video game development.”

“At the end of the day, I don’t want to leave this job. I love it,” Bollig stated, “but if I did choose to leave this job, I know that the experience that 
I’ve gained here over the past few years would be very beneficial. I know that CHTC gave me the opportunity to gain that experience.”
