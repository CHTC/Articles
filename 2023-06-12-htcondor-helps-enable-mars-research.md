The U.S. Geological Survey goes off-planet in its recent release of 3D models and images of the Mars surface.
Gathered through a join effort from the [Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter](https://mars.nasa.gov/mro/) and the 
[High Resolution Imaging Experiment](https://mars.nasa.gov/mro/mission/instruments/hirise/) the images collected amounted to years of work and hundreds of terabytes of data.  

With >155,000 images collected and ready to be released to the public the USGS relied on HTCondor to do the
necessary pre-processing to produce "scientifically useful images and associated metadata". Streaming from 
the NASA Planetary Data System cloud holdings, HTCondor processed the 114 TB of data in 4 hours, with more than 4,000 jobs running simultaneously throughout.
