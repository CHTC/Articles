CHTC users recorded the most ever usage in the CHTC Pool on October 18th this year - utilizing 
over 700,000 core hours -  only to have that record broken again a mere two days later on Oct 20th, 
with a total of 710,796 core hours reached.

The Center for High Throughput (CHTC) users are hard at work smashing records with two almost consecutive record numbers of core hour usage. 
October 20th was the highest daily core hour in the CHTC Pool with 710,796 hours utilized, a feat attained 
just two days after the October 18th record break of 705,801 core hours. 

What is contributing to these records? One factor likely is UW’s investment in new hardware. 
UW-Madison’s research computing hardware recently underwent a [substantial hardware refresh](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/DoIt-Article-Summary.html), 
adding 207 new servers representing over 40,000 “batch slots” of computing capacity.

However, additional capacity requires researchers ready and capable to use it. 
The efforts of the CHTC facilitation team, led by Christina Koch, contributed to
this readiness. Since September 1, CHTC's Research Computing Facilitators have met
with 70 new users for an introductory consultation, and there have been over 80 
visits to the twice-weekly drop-in office hours hosted by the facilitation team.
Koch notes that "using large-scale computing can require skills and concepts that
are new to most researchers - we are here to help bridge that gap."

Finally, the hard work of the researchers themselves is another linchpin to these records. 
Over 80 users that span many fields of science contributed to this success, including 
these users with substantial usage:

- [Ice Cube Neutrino Observatory](https://icecube.wisc.edu): an observatory operated by University of Madison, designed to observe the cosmos from deep within the South Pole ice.
- [ECE_miguel](https://www.ece.uw.edu/people/miguel-a-ortega-vazquez/): In the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Joshua San Miguel’s group explores new paradigms in computer architecture. 
- [MSE_Szlufarska](https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/mse/Faculty/Szlufarska_Izabela/): Isabel Szlufarska’s lab focuses on computational materials science, mechanical behavior at the nanoscale using atomic scale modeling to understand and design new materials.
- [Genetics_Payseur](https://payseur.genetics.wisc.edu): Genetics professor Bret Payseur’s lab uses genetics and genomics to understand mechanisms of evolution.
- [Pharmacy_Jiang](https://apps.pharmacy.wisc.edu/sopdir/jiaoyang_jiang/index.php):  Pharmacy professor Jiaoyang Jiang’s interests span the gap between biology and chemistry by focusing on identifying the roles of protein post-translational modifications in regulating human physiological and pathological processes.
- [EngrPhys_Franck](https://www.franck.engr.wisc.edu): Jennifer Franck’s group specializes in the development of new experimental techniques at the micro and nano scales with the goal of providing unprecedented full-field 3D access to real-time imaging and deformation measurements in complex soft matter and cellular systems.
- [BMI_Gitter](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~gitter/):  In Biostatistics and Computer Sciences, Anthony Gitter’s lab conducts computational biology research that brings together machine learning techniques and problems in biology
- [DairyScience_Dorea](https://andysci.wisc.edu/directory/joao-ricardo-reboucas-dorea/): Joao Dorea’s Animal and Dairy Science group focuses on the development of high-throughput phenotyping technologies.

Any UW student or researcher who wants to utilize high throughput of computing resources 
towards a given problem can harness the capacity of CHTC Pool.
