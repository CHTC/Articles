Joao Dorea from the Digital Livestock Lab explains how the use of 
high-throughput computing is used in the field of animal and dairy 
sciences. Computer vision systems and sensors are used to collect 
animal-level phenotypic data on cows to make more optimized decisions
about what to do with each animal in terms of health, nutrition, 
reproduction, and genetics. One shortcoming of doing this has to do
with the sheer size of data that is collected. Processing and 
storing tens of thousands of images of cows requires significant 
computation resources.

_The vision of the Digital Livestock Lab is to create state-of-the-art 
computer vision systems and the largest public database for livestock._

By utilizing HTCondor and collaborating with the CHTC, the Digital 
Livestock Lab has been able to focus their time and money on the livestock,
and not acquire more computational resources. This lab has been able to do 
things no one else has been able to, simply because they now have access to 
resources to help them handle the size of the data theyâ€™re collecting and the
capacity so they can internalize it. HTCondor allows them to run many jobs 
and experiments congruently in shorter amounts of time. Being able to handle
and run a large number of data sets has given the Digital Livestock Lab quite 
an edge over other laboratories, thanks to HTCondor and collaborations with
the faculty at the CHTC!
