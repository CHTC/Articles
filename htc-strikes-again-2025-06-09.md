## ðŸ”­ How AI and Supercomputers Are Revealing the Secrets of Black Holes

Astronomers are using cutting-edge AI and high-throughput computing to unlock hidden details in the iconic images of black holes. By training neural networks on millions of simulations, researchers discovered that the black hole at the center of our Milky Way is spinning at nearly top speedâ€”and its energy comes from hot electrons, not jets. This breakthrough, powered by the Center for High Throughput Computing, is reshaping our understanding of the universeâ€™s most mysterious objects.
