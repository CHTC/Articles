**Did you always know you would end up in computational research?**

I always knew that I wanted to go into something science-related, but not necessarily with a computational focus. When I was in high school, I knew I didn't want to do medicine 
because my family was very medicine-focused, so I explored the concept of food science. But I had already committed to the University of Michigan, which did not have a food 
science program, and decided to do four years there to get a B.S. in Biochemistry. When I graduated, I was still interested in exploring the food science route, so I did a Ph.D.
at the University of California, Davis, in food science.

  

Exploring the computational side of my research ended up being more enjoyable than the actual food science side, but since my background was in the life sciences, I struggled 
with the computational side. I ended up finding some amazing mentors outside of my lab and becoming a part of this computational research community that helped teach me skills 
to do my work. In the end, I appreciated them so much and I loved what they had done. I knew this was what I wanted to do — help other people do their research.

  
  

**What was your path to becoming a research computing facilitator?**

One of the communities that I was exposed to in grad school while trying to complete my research was called The Carpentries. The Carpentries provides a lot of resources for 
teaching computational tools, and I loved the community so much that I became an instructor for them. As a part of being an instructor, you’re also put on their mailing lists, 
and it was the facilitators here [the UW-Madison Center for High Throughput Computing (CHTC)] who posted this job to that mailing list. It was not even a question for me; I 
knew this was the job for me.

  
  

**Has coming from a biochemistry and food science background to computational research been a learning curve?**

Absolutely. It’s a challenge not being able to fully understand the details of what's going on with our various high throughput and high performance computation resources. But 
there’s such a breadth of what we do that even a computer scientist on the team likely does not understand every component. However, I also think this makes me much better at 
doing my job. It can be challenging for a computer scientist to talk to someone from biology or a different discipline when they have not carried out bench-top or field research
before. It's really important to have a facilitator who can serve as the middleman, where I can communicate with the computer scientist but can also distill it for an individual
researcher and see how that's going to apply to their research projects.

  
  

**What are some of your tasks and favorite parts of your role?**

My favorite part is working with other CHTC staff members. The CHTC team is very collaborative and so much fun to work with. I also enjoy the creative exchange of ideas.

  

As a facilitator, my role requires interdisciplinary and multi-tasking components of my job. I like to be able to spend part of my day learning about a tool to help a researcher and 
another part of my day planning a training event that's coming up — I'm not restricted to just one science domain.

  

I also love working with researchers and hearing about what a grad student or a lab is going to be diving into over the next few years as they plan future analyses, or helping them
identify solutions for computational problems they are currently tackling. It's fun to be able to see what science is underway, what their results could show, and how it could help
others.

  
  
  
  

**What are some challenges and triumphs you have faced while on the job?**

Let's start with challenges. This job requires an incredible amount of flexibility and multitasking skills. Things could change in a minute, so I need to be able to reassess 
priorities and help facilitate two or three different computing systems. Because my background is not computer science, it’s not something that comes easily.

  

As far as the triumphs, my triumphs are when we help make computing click for researchers. It's an exciting moment when you see that they understand what they're doing and that 
they understand how to apply these resources to make their research better.

  

**What impact do you hope to have?**

I want to help advance research in whatever way that I can. I am inspired by researchers of different domains, what it [high throughput computing] can do for people today and in 
the future, and how it can be all interconnected. Research can be a very isolating experience. To have that researcher know that they are being supported and that someone’s on 
their team as much as we can be is a goal of mine.

  
  

**Can you tell me about your involvement with the NIAID?**

The [OSG] has many collaborations with different government, academic, and nonprofit entities, one of them being the [National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)].
As a part of that collaboration, I was able to travel to Uganda.

  

In Uganda, I led a workshop for researchers who were part of the African Centers of Excellence (ACE) in the bioinformatics program. I worked with the researchers there to show 
them how their research could benefit from using OSPool resources.

  

Being able to meet with researchers in person at Makerere University was just incredible — there are so many things that are hard to grasp until you're there. They have a 
high-performance computing system over there that, in theory, they can use, but they don't have stable power. I would be sitting in a meeting with important leaders from universities
and different U.S. computing centers, and the power shuts off. I began to understand what their challenges were and what we could do to address them.

  

One of the questions that I still think about so much is that I was mentioning office hours in my talk as a form of support and just kept saying “Don't worry, you're not alone.
We have office hours.” About midway through my talk, somebody raised their hand and asked what office hours were. That cultural difference made me reevaluate how we can provide 
better support for communities in the U.S. and our collaborators abroad. It also made me realize that researchers can have vast differences in their backgrounds.

**How do you spend your time outside of work?**

I travel a fair amount for work and fun. I'm really lucky my family is around the United States, so I almost always have some place that I can go.

  

I enjoy the Madison art scene with friends. There's a craft fair you can almost certainly find me at.
