    This past July, the OSG User School 2022 welcomed students from across the globe to learn how to use high-throughput computing (HTC) in their scientific research.
    
    This year five students from Makerere University in Uganda and the University Of Sciences, Techniques, and Technologies of Bamako in Mali, Africa, participated as a part of The U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the African Centers for Excellence in Bioinformatics and Data-Intensive Science (ACE) partnership program.

  UW-Madison’s research computing hardware recently underwent a substantial hardware refresh, adding 207 new servers representing over 40,000 “batch slots” of computing capacity. This refresh and plan of an annual commitment at the campus level to sustain it will allow UW researchers to push the limits of their research on an all-new sustained shared infrastructure. The funding for this was made possible by a $4.3 million investment from the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF), which will remove some of the worries for individual PIs of having to stand up their own facilities or that they won’t have access to it at any point in the future. Now, they will have a sustainable computational infrastructure to harness more computing capacity and produce computationally heavy research results more efficiently and will always be able to access.

  The research computing investments, equipment upgrades, and services to support researchers were made possible by the growing collaboration between:
  - [Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF)](https://www.warf.org/)
  - [Center for High Throughput Computing (CHTC)](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/) in the [School of Computer, Data & Information Sciences (CDIS)](https://cdis.wisc.edu/)
  - [Morgridge Institute for Research](https://morgridge.org/)
  - [Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Graduate Education (OVCRGE)](https://research.wisc.edu/about/)
  - [Division of Information Technology (DoIT)](https://it.wisc.edu/about/division-of-information-technology/)
