The [OSPool](https://osg-htc.org/services/ospool/), the [CMS Pool](https://cms.cern/), and the [IGWN Pool](https://computing.docs.ligo.org/guide/igwn/)
alone accounted for over a billion HTCondor jobs that ran over the past year. There were 425 million jobs from the OSPool, 600 million from the CMS Pool, and 60 million from the IGWN Pool.

On the [HTCondor site](https://htcondor.com/about) you can view data on jobs submitted across these pools, and the pools of other collaborators.
You can also visit the [OSPool page](https://osg-htc.org/services/ospool/) to see specific data, including day-to-day numbers on jobs submitted, or the [OSDF page](https://osg-htc.org/services/osdf/data) for information on 
numbers of available repositories, objects transferred, and petabytes of data delivered.
