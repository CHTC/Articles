---

An increasing number of campuses across the country are making an impact on science and [contributing a share of their computing capacity](https://osg-htc.org/services/open_science_pool/institutions) to the OSPool. The OSPool is a crucial resource for researchers across the United States, providing access to any researcher affiliated with a U.S. institution to large-scale computational capacity to drive progress in open science. Using [HTCondor](https://htcondor.org/) and other distributed computing technologies, the OSPool is designed to support high throughput workloads that consist of large ensembles of independent computations.

In the past year, 75 institutions contributed to the OSPool, setting a new record for the number of contributors. Many new campuses, diverse in size and location, are sharing their computing capacity and contributing their computing resources to help drive innovation and advance open science.

These campus contributions over the past 12 months have enabled PATh Access Points to complete more than 200M jobs that consumed more than 449K GPU hours and 250M core hours. In the past year, these contributions impacted 57 fields of science, 200 projects, and over 500 users.

Read [here](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/campus-onboarding.html) to learn more about integrating into the OSPool and testimonials from two contributing institutions.

[Note: Any researcher performing Open Science in the US can [become an OSPool user](https://portal.osg-htc.org/application). The OSPool provides its users with fair-share access (no allocation needed!) to processing and storage capacity contributed by university campuses, government-supported supercomputing institutions, and research collaborations.]
