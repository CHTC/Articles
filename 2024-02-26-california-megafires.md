**Studying the impact of two high-fire years in California on over 600 species, ecologists enlist help from CHTC.**

The western United States is seeing an unprecedented increase in wildfires. 
Researcher [Jessalyn Ayars](https://www.fs.usda.gov/research/about/people/jessalyn.ayars) 
and her team examined how severe wildfires impact the habitats of over 600 species across 
two megafire years in California. Ayars, a former Post-Baccalaureate Research Fellow at the 
Rocky Mountain Research Station located in Colorado, investigated this impact on wildlife 
with Dr. [Gavin Jones](https://www.fs.usda.gov/research/about/people/gavin.jones) and 
Dr. [Anu Kramer](https://peery.russell.wisc.edu/anu-kramer/) of the University of Wisconsin—Madison. 
Their research was enabled by the [Center for High Throughput Computing (CHTC)](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/) 
and [published](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2312909120#sec-3) in the Proceedings 
of the National Academy of Sciences.

  
“Megafires are extremely large, high-severity fires. They are increasing worldwide, especially 
in the western U.S.” Ayars explained. “In 2020 and 2021 California experienced a severe fire season.” 
California was also favorable for the team to study due to its extensive maps showing the habitat 
suitability for all vertebrate species. Typically, ecologists will study the effects of one species 
or a small number of species after wildfire — Ayars’ research is novel in that it surveys a wide 
range of species.

  
Surveying a wide range of species across a state led to a bottleneck of data to analyze: “Each 
species was a gigantic math problem across the state of California. We were dealing with 608 
vertebrae species, each with a suitability map the size of California at a 30-meter resolution. 
To get our results we needed to overlay the fire maps [with] the habitat suitability maps to 
see how much area burned, and in what severity.”


Very quickly, Ayars knew that doing this hundreds of times by hand was impractical. “That’s just 
so much data — it wasn’t possible to do it all on a desktop computer,” she said. Ayars learned about 
the Center for High Throughput Computing (CHTC) from her advisor at the Rocky Mountain Research Station, 
Dr. Gavin Jones, who received his Ph.D. from UW-Madison and had connections with CHTC from previous research.

  
CHTC helped Ayars and her team break down large chunks of data into smaller jobs that could run 
simultaneously using [the OSPool](https://osg-htc.org/services/open_science_pool.html). “The folks at CHTC 
were super helpful in setting me up for all the processing, breaking down that giant problem into one 
species and one fire severity at a time so they could run parallel,” she said.
  

“I would recommend anyone interested in using HTC [high throughput computing] or just curious about whether 
or not it would be helpful for their work to reach out to CHTC,” she said. “It’s a great resource and they’re 
great at teaching you.” Ayars gave a special shout-out to [Rachel Lombardi](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/staff/lombardi-rachel/) 
and [Christina Koch,](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/staff/koch-christina/) two Research Computing Facilitators at CHTC. 
Research computing facilitators help new or potential users of CHTC services understand what computing resources 
are available and provide support for adapting workflows for HTC.

  

Ayars hopes that her team’s work will be a “call to action” for other wildlife ecologists studying the impact of wildfires 
on species. “These conditions are so different from what wildlife evolved in, and from what researchers have studied 
wildfire in. It’s hard to say how wildlife will respond to these wildfires going forward.”
