# Registration is open for the European HTCondor Workshop, September 24-27


This year’s European HTCondor Workshop will be held from September 24 to 27th hosted by NIKHEF-Amsterdam, the Dutch National Institute for Subatomic Physics, in the beautiful Dutch capital city of Amsterdam.


The workshop will be an excellent occasion for learning from the sources (the developers!) about HTCondor, exchanging with your colleagues about experiences and plans and providing your feedback to the experts. The HTCondor Compute Entry point (CE) will be covered as well. Participation is open to all organizations (including companies) and persons interested in HTCondor (and by no means restricted to particle physics and/or academia!) If you know potentially interested persons, don’t hesitate to make them aware of this opportunity.


The workshop will cover both using and administering HTCondor; topics will be chosen to best match participants’ interests. We would very much like to know about your use of HTCondor, in your project, your experience and your plans. You are warmly encouraged to propose a short presentation.


There will also time and space for short, maybe spontaneous interactive participation (“show us your toolbox sessions”) which proved to be very popular in previous meetings.


Registration is now open! Find more information on the [event page](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1386170/).


To ease travel, the workshop will begin Tuesday morning and end around Friday lunchtime.
