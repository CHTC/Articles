We want to thank our Throughput Computing Week 2025 (HTC25) keynote speaker, Dr. Erik Wright, for his presentation “Biological Diversity at an Unfathomable Scale,” in which he explored how high-throughput computing is being used to unlock the functions of novel genes. Wright highlighted how the OSPool is a “game changer,” noting that the OSPool changed his trajectory as a researcher, and that without it, he “would not have been able to build all these different tools that biologists use.” As he put it: “We are all united across all the different domains involved in Condor by unfathomable scales in what we study.”
