The Center for High Throughput Computing (CHTC) launched a transformative 12-week Fellows Program this past summer. Eight fellows participated and were supported in their work by ten mentors from CHTC staff. This inaugural 2024 CHTC Fellows Program was designed to immerse undergraduate and graduate students in the world of high throughput computing. The fellows were matched with CHTC projects based upon their individual interests and skills.The [project topics varied](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/fellowships/fellows), some involving machine learning, performance analysis, or designing data schemas, but they all were driven by real world issues the CHTC team wanted to address. The success of the 2024 program has led to its renewal for Summer 2025 with applications [open](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/fellowships/#:~:text=Duration%20of%20Fellowship%20and%20Total,Program%20provides%20%24650%2Fweek%20stipend.) as of November and a new set of projects posted.

In June, at the outset in the program, the fellows quickly learned that they had large obstacles ahead. Their projects were complex as the existing software stack was large and the solutions challenging to implement. However, they were able to adapt to these hurdles with the help of their mentors. The program fostered an environment of collaboration and learning between the fellows and their mentors, and included weekly regular check-ins between mentors and fellows, with weekly one-on-one discussions. There were also weekly educational sessions that ranged from GitHub practices to cyberinfrastructure training. “I thought that the best part of the educational sessions was the opportunity to interact with CHTC staff and ask questions about various computing topics. I think everybody has their own way of thinking about things when it comes to CS (computer science), and getting to hear from CHTC staff was a really nice way to be exposed to some of those different perspectives,” [Kristina Zhao](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/fellowships/reports/2024/kristina-zhao), a summer 2024 fellow, commented.

During the summer, the fellows participated in the Throughput Computing Week ([HTC24](https://osg-htc.org/events/throughput-computing-2024/)), a conference to learn more about high throughput computing which included presentations and conversations with community leaders. Their presentations at the HTC24 were one highlight of the summer, showcasing their project work and sharpening their public speaking and presentation skills. For team bonding during HTC24 fellows engaged in social activities with HTC participants, including a lake shore run, kayaking and karaoke. [Thinh Nguyen](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/fellowships/reports/2024/thinh-nguyen) loved the collaboration aspect, commenting that he enjoyed the social events and “think they… add richness to everyone's experience.”

The Fellows Program also provided opportunities for professional development. The fellows were motivated by the desire to gain practical experience in a field that combines academic research and real-world applications. [Ryan Boone’s](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/fellowships/reports/2024/ryan-boone) project marked his first long-term endeavor in computer science, and he took great pride in the effort he invested and the final product he created. His project, the "Grid Exerciser," aimed to diagnose performance issues within the [OSPool](https://osg-htc.org/services/open_science_pool.html), a complex system providing distributed computing capacity. With the technical challenges he faced with his project, Boone’s collaboration with his mentor provided him with valuable guidance. Boone could bounce ideas off his mentor and peers which enhanced his problem-solving skills. Due to the complex nature of all of the different components in high throughput computing, more experienced mentors guided the fellows’ work. 

[Ben Staehle](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/fellowships/reports/2024/ben-staehle), who worked on tracking server inventory and elevation with his mentor Joe Bartkowiak, appreciated the collaboration and one on one meetings. He stated, “I really appreciated the fact that Bartkowiak was willing to provide support, feedback, and guidance wherever I needed or asked for, while also giving me space to let my own ideas play out.” In the end, it was this dynamic blend of mentorship and independence that empowered the fellows to challenge their own thinking, pushing the boundaries of what was possible both individually and as a team.

Summer fellow [Patrick Brophy](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/fellowships/reports/2024/patrick-brophy) highlighted the importance of having a mentor throughout his summer. His project, “Expanded Pelican Origin Monitoring," involved implementing new monitoring probes to enhance the data flow and system health alerts. His mentor provided direction in many disciplines, while also allowing Brophy to take the lead and explore some solutions independently. This balance of guidance and independence facilitated Brophy’s growth, helping him gain confidence and hone his problem-solving abilities. Following the end of the 2024 Fellows Program, Brophy is continuing to work as a CHTC student intern this school year, and will be joining the CHTC team full-time as a Research Software Engineer once he graduates this coming spring.

Both Brophy and Boone also emphasized the significance of collaboration amongst the fellows during the summer. The environment created by the CHTC where everyone worked in adjacent cubicles and met as a group regularly allowed fellows to engage with others, share ideas, and tackle problems with the help of each other. Brophy noted how discussions with peers during staff meetings helped broaden his perspective on larger problems in high throughput computing. 

The fellows gained a diverse range of lessons from their experiences. Nguyen highlighted the importance of translating complex technical ideas into accessible concepts. [Pratham Patel](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/fellowships/reports/2024/pratham-patel) learned the significance of modularization and the value of clear documentation in complex systems. They also gained critical insights into effective collaboration through version control using Git and GitHub, managing pull requests, and resolving conflicts. The fellows deepened their understanding of computing, but also the importance of patience, flexibility, and communication in collaborative environments.

In August, the fellows presented their final projects at their final CHTC staff meeting. They shared with pride how their summer was spent tackling complex issues and making connections with other fellows. At the end of the program, the fellows each produced a final project summary and capped off the end of the summer with an afternoon on the Memorial Union Terrace with their mentors and other CHTC team members.

The CHTC Fellows Program shows how the power of mentorship and collaboration can nurture the next generation of computer scientists interested in both professional development and making a difference in the world of science and high throughput computing. Through the combined efforts of dedicated mentors and enthusiastic fellows, the program not only advanced important projects in high throughput computing but also equipped participants with invaluable skills and experiences that will serve them well in their future careers.
