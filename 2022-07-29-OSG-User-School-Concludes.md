Thank you to all those who attended the OSG User School 2022. Throughout the week, students
learned how to use HTC systems to run large-scale computing applications through lectures,
discussions, and hands-on activities.

All materials and lesson plans can be found on the
[School's website](https://osg-htc.org/user-school-2022/materials/).
