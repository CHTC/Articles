Breaking ground is as symbolic as it is exciting – a metaphorical act of consecrating a new location and the start of something new. On April 25th, UW-Madison broke ground on 1240 W. Johnson St., Madison WI; a location that will become the new building for the School of Computer, Data & Information Sciences and the new home for the Center for High Throughput Computing (CHTC) in 2025.

“The new CDIS building is the latest crest in a wave of expansion and renewal enhancing the campus landscape to meet the needs of current and future Badgers,” [the university reports](https://news.wisc.edu/governor-chancellor-to-break-ground-on-new-home-for-uws-newest-school/).  This building, expected to be nearly 350000 square feet, will be the most sustainable facility on campus and will create a new center of activity for UW, enabling important connections and establishing a tech corridor from Physics and Chemistry to the Discovery Building to the College of Engineering. 

CHTC Technical Lead Todd Tannenbaum wryly remarks that  "while the 1960's charm of our current old building is endearing at times (isn't cinder block making a comeback?), I am inspired by the opportunity to work every day in a new and modern building. I am also especially excited by how this will open up new possibilities for collaboration across not only Comp Sci, but also the community of faculty and researchers in the Information School, Statistics, and Data Sciences."
