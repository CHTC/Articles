As Charles Bowden astutely put it, “summertime is always the best of what might be,” and the Center for High Throughput
Computing ([CHTC](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/)) couldn’t agree more. Enter the Fellows Program: a new 12-week summer
initiative where participants collaborate with mentors to each deliver a project that will contribute to high throughput
computing in support of the nation’s scientific community.

Aimed at providing extraordinary opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, this program offers a chance 
to collaboratively develop software for high throughput computing and cyberinfrastructure, operate complex service 
environments, and facilitate the utilization of large-scale computational services. Coupled with hands-on experience
and training, the fellows will gain technical skills, as well as research and collaboration skills. It offers these 
students insight into how scientists employ research computing as a tool to advance their studies.

The summer program kicked off on June 3rd with 8 fellows, 10 mentors, CHTC leaders and the camaraderie of coffee and
doughnuts. The team was inaugurated by program director [Brian Bockelman's](https://morgridge.org/profile/brian-bockelman/) 
welcoming address, shortly followed by mentor meetings and digging into the procedures, schedule reviews, HR policies,
and breakout sessions for mentor/fellow onboarding.

Three days later, the fellows presented to the CHTC team their first (out of three) presentations, detailing their
projects for the upcoming 12 weeks.

In addition to the initial presentation during the first week of the program, the fellows will deliver two more talks:
the first at High Throughput Computing 2024 ([HTC](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/events/2024/01/throughput-computing-2024)),
where they will give lightning talks about their projects and the challenges they are addressing, and a final
presentation at the end of the program to share the results of their work and their learnings.

Out of a deep pool of over 80 applicants, only eight fellows were selected. Among them are Ben Staehle, Kristina Zhao,
Neha Talluri, Patrick Brophy, Pratham Patel, Ryan Boone, Thinh Nguyen, and Wil Cram. You can read more about their
projects [here](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/fellowships/fellows).

Through mentorship and support, the CHTC Fellows program aims to develop the Fellows potential and contribute to 
research computing. Whether in research, creativity, or social impact, this fellowship strives to foster the next 
generation of budding engineers and scientists.
