# Articles
This repository contains all articles published on CHTC, PATh, and HTCSS websites. It seperates them out so we can deploy the same article more easily and reduce build times well creating articles. You can preview the articles here -> [Article Previews]([preview website](https://chtc.github.io/article-preview/)).

## Creating a new Article

**Best practice is to create your article as a preview first. Look at [the preview guide](#previewing-your-article) for details.** 

To create a new article you must follow the following steps:
1. [Create a new Branch](#create-a-new-branch)
2. [Add a new Article](#add-a-new-article)
3. [Populate the new Article](#populate-the-new-article)
4. [Create a Pull-Request to merge the article into production](#create-a-pull-request-to-merge-the-article-into-production)

### Create a new Branch

Each Article should have its own branch. We use branches to manage 
when we put each article into production. So if two changes are on 
one branch we are forced to wait until both of those changes are ready
for production.

### Add a new Article

Once you are in your new branch you can Add file -> Create new file.

You should use the format below as the file name with the estimated
date for when you plan to publish the article. This should be updated 
to the actual date it is made public in the future.

```markdown
YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md
```

### Populate the new Article

#### Frontmatter

These articles are distributed to a variety of websites so it is 
important they follow the same template. 

Below you will find the yaml frontmatter that is read by the website 
to fill in information about the article. 

_Add this frontmatter to the top and the article content will go below_

```yaml
---
title: <Article Title>

author: <First Last>

publish_on:
  - <htcondor, path, osg, chtc, pelican> - This indicates what website this article will be shown on
  - <htcondor, path, osg, chtc, pelican> - If more then one then add as a list
  
type: <news, user, tech-blog> - This indicates if this article is based on a user's experience with our services or a news story about what we have done. 

canonical_url: "<This is a absolute url that points to the canonical site>"

tag:
- chtc_featured_article <If you would like this article listed first on the CHTC news page: Note if you add one you must remove one.> 

image:
  path: "<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CHTC/Articles/main/images/...>" - An image that will populate the link preview
  alt: Text Description of image
  
excerpt: <Same as description but used for the cards>

banner_src: "<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CHTC/Articles/main/images/>" - Optional - An image that will be used as a website banner
banner_alt: Text Description of image
---
```

##### Canonical URL

You can use the below list to decide the correct canonical URL, fill in the appropriate tags as suggested above for naming the file. 

- CHTC: https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/<title>.html
- OSG: https://osg-htc.org/spotlights/<title>.html
- PATh: https://path-cc.io/news/<YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title\>/
- HTCondor: https://htcondor.org/featured-users/<YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title\>.html

##### Reserved Characters

Some characters mean something special in `yaml` which is the format of the frontmatter at the top of the article. One such 
is the colon (`:`) which denotes a key-value pair. Since it has a reserved use you must put any values that include it in 
quotations to prevent it from being misinterpretted.

For example: 

This is wrong because the url below is not quoted and contains a `:`. 

```
image:
  path: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CHTC/Articles/main/images/image.jpg
```

So we fix it like so:

```
image:
  path: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CHTC/Articles/main/images/image.jpg"
```

##### Multi-line values

For values that span multiple lines in the metadata on the top of a article you must format them to be 
valid yaml or just remove the line breaks and make it one line. 

**Invalid - Value includes a newline in it without the appropriate | and tabbing**
```
excerpt: This is a really really really really really really really really really really really really
really really really really really really really really really really long excerpt. 
```

**Valid - Best Option - Most Readable**
```
excerpt: |
  This is a really really really really really really really really really really really
  really really really really really really really really really really really long excerpt. 
``` 

**Valid - Also Okay - Sometimes doesn't fit on screen**
```
excerpt: This is a really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really long excerpt. 
```

#### Content

The content will be coming from your google doc. An easy way to convert a google document into markdown is by 
copying and pasting the google doc content into https://stackedit.io/app# on the left. You can then copy the content
newly formatted on the left into the page. 

##### Images

All images follow the same url scheme as those in the frontmatter. They will always be prefixed with `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CHTC/Articles/main/images/` and appended with the image name. You can see examples below.

##### Markdown Templates

This is a list of items that you might want to add to your article. These are all pulled from existing articles, so you 
can see how they present in production.

With all of these templates you will have to switch out the:

- src your image - Example -> `src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CHTC/Articles/main/images/pratham.jpeg'`
- alt of your image - Example -> `alt="Pratham"`
- The captions -> Example: `<p>Fellows at their first presentation, introducing themselves and their projects.</p>` and `<figcaption>Electron Beam Ion Source / Brookhaven National Laboratory</figcaption>`

###### 2 Images Side by Side

Example: https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/2024-chtc-fellows.html

```html
<div class="row justify-content-center">
<div class="col-12 col-md-6">
<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CHTC/Articles/main/images/pratham.jpeg' class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Pratham">
</div>
<div class="col-12 col-md-6">
<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CHTC/Articles/main/images/fellows.jpeg' class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Fellows">
</div>
<div class="col">
<p>Fellows at their first presentation, introducing themselves and their projects.</p>
</div>
</div>
```

###### Image As Banner 

Example: https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/collaborations-epic-eic.html

```html
<figure>
<img style="width:100%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CHTC/Articles/main/images/epic-eic-collab.jpg" alt=" Electron Beam Ion Source / Brookhaven National Laboratory"/>
<figcaption>Electron Beam Ion Source / Brookhaven National Laboratory</figcaption>
</figure>
```

###### Image Floated Left

Example: https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/unravelling-antibiotic-resistance.html

```html
<figure style="float: left; margin: 0 1rem 1rem 0;">
<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CHTC/Articles/main/images/wright-smile.jpg' height="420" width="300" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Erik smiling">
</figure>
```

###### Image Floated Right

Example: https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/unravelling-antibiotic-resistance.html

```html
<figure style="float: right; margin: 0 1rem 0 1rem;">
 <img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CHTC/Articles/main/images/wright-lab.jpg' height="420" width="300" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Erik in the wet lab">
</figure>
```




### Create a Pull-Request to merge the article into production

When you are confident with your content you can create a Pull-Request,
which is a request to have your content moved to production. To do this 
go the Pull Requests tab and choose your branch as the compare branch.

Ping the people you would like to review your article,
and they will look it over make suggestions/approve your article.

At this point it can be merged into main.

### Things to remember when working in this folder

- `date` is omitted on purpose, Jekyll populates this field from the filename.
    - Discrepancy in front matter and filename dates can cause unexpected results

- All images must be absolute
    - As these images will be served from a variety of folders and depths you must use an absolute url 
    - Absolute URL to use: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CHTC/Articles/main/images/`
    - You should put all of your articles in the main folder and import from there even in the dev branch
  
## Previewing your Article
  
Best practice is to create your article in our development
branch first so that you can view it as if it was in production.

To view your article in development you must:
- Change into the development branch
  - You can do this with the github navigation or click [here](https://github.com/CHTC/Articles/tree/development)
- Create a new file
  - This will use the same logic as steps [2](#add-a-new-article) and [3](#populate-a-new-article) of the guide above.
- View your article
  - When you commit your changes you can view your article ( after a couple of minutes to process ) on the [preview website](https://chtc.github.io/article-preview/)
- When you are ready to move this article to production you can copy and paste this article and its images using the [Creating a new Article](#creating-a-new-article) guide. 
- You can see if your change has been made to the website by following the top build [here](https://github.com/CHTC/article-preview/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment). After this circle is green it will be live on the preview page. 

## Deploying Articles to Production

All of the changes that are pushed to the [main branch](https://github.com/CHTC/Articles/tree/main)
will automatically have there changes distributed to the PATh websites and previews made. 

To finish deploying them to production you should:

1. Preview the article and make sure it is rendering like you're expecting.

    Below are links pointing to the new article preview url of all four websites. 

    **Make sure to wait ~15 minutes after the change the main before viewing these so the preview can build.**
