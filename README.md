## Things to remember when working in this folder

- `date` is omitted on purpose, Jekyll populates this field from the filename.
    - Discrepancy in front matter and filename dates can cause unexpected results

- All images must be absolute
    - As these images will be served from a variety of folders and depths you must use an absolute url 
    - Absolute URL to use: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CHTC/Articles/main/images/`
