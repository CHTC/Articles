  Five thousand miles and seven time zones were no obstacle to dedicated researchers from Uganda and Mali participating in their first high-throughput computing training session. On February 15, bioinformatics graduate students and faculty members from [Makerere University](https://www.mak.ac.ug/) in Uganda and the [University Of Science Technical And Technologies De Bamako (USTTB)](http://www.usttb.edu.ml/) in Mali engaged in a customized training organized by OSG’s Research Computing Facilitators.

**Dr. Mariam Quiñones** spearheaded this cross-continent collaboration between OSG, the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and the African Centers for Excellence (ACE), which provides bioinformatics training for graduate students and other researchers at Makerere University and USTTB. Quiñones leads the NIAID’s Science Support section of the Bioinformatics and Computational Biosciences Branch within the Office of Cyber Infrastructure and Computational Biology, which was why ACE invited her team to provide training to students in the ACE program.

In prior work, the NIAID-ACE leadership team realized a need for additional computing resources to train graduate students, and Quinones knew precisely where to turn.


Envisioning the impact of OSG resources on the ACE community’s limited computer infrastructure, Quiñones approached OSG Research Facilitation lead Lauren Micheal with the idea of an OSG-organized high-throughput computing training session for the students and faculty within the ACE program. 

The NIAID’s success in running computational work on the OSG’s Open Science Pool (OSPool) made Quinones think the impact might even reach beyond students trained by the ACE program. Predicting the spread of this OSG adoption, Quiñones remarks, “[w]e hope some of the faculty and associated staff actively generating data from data-intense research projects will begin to use OSG.”

In preparation for the training, OSG’s Research Facilitation Team planned to go beyond the usual introduction to the OSPool. This time around, the team designed a new, hands-on tutorial that incorporated the [BWA software](https://github.com/OSGConnect/tutorial-bwa), a tool commonly used in bioinformatics and familiar to the students.

“Given the shared bioinformatics needs of the students, we wanted to make sure the content went beyond our general New User Training format by encouraging conversation among training participants and using examples they’d connect with,” Michael reflected. “It seemed to pay off, given the level of engagement.”

Echoing Micheal’s sentiment, Quiñones agrees that the training “...went phenomenal, really!”. Looking to the future, she imagines that OSG training and access to the OSPool will be an essential part of NIAID-ACE training efforts.
 
Through numerous collaborations with NIAID, African institutions, governments, and private-sector companies, ACE aims to enhance access to computational capabilities and infrastructure. This access will empower researchers and students to accelerate biomedical research and drive discoveries that could impact the treatment, prevention, and diagnosis of diseases in Africa and across the globe.

And while high-throughput computing and the OSPool can play an essential role in advancing the bioinformatics behind some of these efforts, Michael emphasizes that the benefits are undoubtedly mutual for the OSG:

“By working with ACE, engaging with participants, and adding documented bioinformatics examples to our resources –– OSG is better poised to support other researchers doing similar work and customize our training materials for other domains flexibly.”
