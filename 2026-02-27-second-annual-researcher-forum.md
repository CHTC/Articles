The second annual [CHTC Researcher Forum](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/uw-research-computing/researcher-forum-2026) took place on February 17th 2026, connecting CHTC users and research computing community members across UW-Madison campus. The event started off with an introductory presentation from PI [Brian Bockleman](https://morgridge.org/profile/brian-bockelman/), followed by Center for Throughput Computing “[CHTC](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/uw-research-computing/index.html)” updates from the Research Facilitation team. UW-Madison alumni Dr. [Ariana Neigreiro](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/ml-in-dairy-farming.html) gave the keynote address on her work using [HTCondor](https://htcondor.org/), DAGman workflows, and [Pelican](https://pelicanplatform.org/) to develop tools for dairy cattle management.

Researchers participated in a poster session, displaying their research and how they’re using high throughput computing (HTC) to advance their work. Presentations ranged from scaling GPU workflows to using HTC to help target chronic gut disease.

[Bioinformatics Café](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/uw-research-computing/bioinformatics-cafe) attendee Izabella Sall from the [O’Leary Research Group](https://www.pediatrics.wisc.edu/research/research-groups/oleary-research-group/) presented her work using HTC to explore alternative cells within the gut that may help alleviate chronic gut disease. CHTC Research Software Engineer [Justin Hiemstra](https://morgridge.org/profile/justin-hiemstra/) presented on integrating [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) with HTCondor at CHTC, and Infrastructure Services Lead [Brian Lin](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/staff/lin-brian/) provided attendees a look inside a CHTC server.
