<p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold;">Save the Date for HTCondor Week May 23 - 26!</p>


Hello HTCondor Users and Collaborators!

We want to invite you to HTCondor Week 2023, our annual HTCondor user conference, from June 5-8, 2023 at the Fluno Center at the Univeristy of Wisconsin-Madison!

More information about registration coming soon.

We will have a variety of in-depth tutorials and talks where you can learn more about HTCondor and how other people are using and deploying HTCondor. Best of all, you can establish contacts and learn best practices from people in industry, government, and academia who are using HTCondor to solve hard problems, many of which may be similar to those you are facing.

And make sure you check out these articles written on presentations from last year's HTCondor Week!
